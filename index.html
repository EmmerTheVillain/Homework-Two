        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Michael Barber, I am currently training and in education to become a full stack software developer. 
          I am currently working a Xerox Service Technician, but am seeking a transition into being a fullstack
          software developer as a career change for better growth opportunities. For the last 5 or so years in this job I have 
          picked up very effective troubleshooting skills, as well as mechanical and electrical break-fix experience. While this 
          is not directly applicable to software development, it is still a skillset that I believe will heavily impact my ability 
          to quickly learn new topics in software development. Outside of my work life I enjoy building custom keyboards and collecting 
          audio recording equipment.

        <h2>Application placeholder!</h2>
        <p>     Since I haven't made any notable works or applications I consider worth adding to a portfolio, I thought 
          I would use some of the custom keyboards. I have built as placeholders! This particular board is the Baguette 66 
          by KBDFans and Enjoy. This is probablymy all-time favorite keyboard that I own. You may notice that several of the 
          keycap sets I have pictured below are pictured on this board, there is absolutely a reason for that! This is a 
          top mount board that was was only available with a brass plate. I have had a custom polypropylene plate made for 
          it, and it really made a huge difference for the sound. The real standout feature of this board is the HHKB 65% 
          layout. Traditionally an HHKB will only be 60%, but I find that I just cannot live without an arrow cluster on a 
          keyboard. There are a handful of 65% HHKBs, but I really think this one is by far the best looking. For the rest 
          of my placeholder items I will be talking about a few of my favorite keycap sets!

          <h3>Novelkeys Cherry Charcoal</h3>
          <img src=".\Assets\images\charcoal.JPG" alt="image of black keycap set">
          <p>For my first portfolio placeholder item I wanted to go with one of my go with one of my favorite sets to 
            recommend to other people, NovelKeys Cherry Charcoal. This set is a pretty classic looking grey on black set, 
            and it can often be found on sale for $50 at NovelKeys.

          <h3>DCS Alps Pingmaster</h3>
          <img src=".\Assets\images\pingmaster.JPG" alt="image of grey keycaps with japanese sublegends">
          <p>
            Placeholder 2 gets a very special keycap set, this is DCS Alps Pingmaster. As its name would suggest, this 
            keycap set is made to use with Alps switches instead of MX style keycaps. That in itself makes them very unique, 
            but in addition to that these are based on a much beloved vintage keyboard, the IBM Pingmaster.

          <h3>EPBT SimpleJA </h3>
          <img src=".\Assets\images\simpleja.JPG" alt="image of beige keycaps with japanese sublegends">
          <p>
            For our third placeholder set we get one of my all-time favorite keycap sets, EPBT SimpleJa. This was one of my 
            first super unique looking keycap sets and because of that it will always hold a special place in my heart. This 
            keycap set was inspired by old japanese POS sales terminals with their cross oriented sublegends, which is in 
            in contrast to the more common four-corners sublegends you see today. Pictured on the brass plate of the Baguette 66.

          <h3>Milkyway Voynich</h3>
          <img src=".\Assets\images\voynich.JPG" alt="image of keycaps with artistic design">
          <p>
            To end out our little keycap placeholder section I wanted to do something special. This is my all-time favorite 
            keycap set, MilkyWay Voynich. This is a keycap set based on the Voynich manuscript. Pictured here on the Baguette 66, 
            we get to see it in its sublegend alphas and novelty modifiers variant and get a good look at the novelty brass and 
            aluminum keycaps from Ramaworks and Salvun.
