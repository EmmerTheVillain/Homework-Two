# Homework-Two Dexcription
 This project is a portfolion made using only CSS and HTML. Since I dont have any produced content this project will instead use placeholders where there would normally be a primary application. In addition to that some of the contact information that would normally be included in a portfolio has been replaced with placeholder information. Rather than using generic pictures and meaningless text as placeholders this project will instead have small snippets of information about custom keyboards and keycaps, one of my personal hobbies.
